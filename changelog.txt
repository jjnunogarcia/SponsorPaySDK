Unified Advertiser and Publisher SDKs into a single one.

App ID can now be alphanumeric.

Added parameters android_id and mac_address (for which the WiFi MAC address is fetched) to the advertiser callback request.


1.1.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added the parameter sdk_version=[release version] to the advertiser callback request.


1.1.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed the default to expect a SPONSORPAY_PROGRAM_ID in the Manifest. The SDK will use this value to fill the program_id parameter in the callback URL.

Added a switch that changes the parameter name in the callback URL to offer_id (SponsorPayAdvertiser.setShouldUseOfferId(boolean value) ). However, in the manifest the parameter is now called SPONSORPAY_PROGRAM_ID regardless of this setting in order to simplify the integration.

The manifest parameter SPONSORPAY_OFFER_ID is no longer in use.
